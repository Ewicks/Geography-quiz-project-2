## Features 

It's important that all pages are responsive on small, medium and large devices. Also that all pages are  
intuitively designed to make it easy for the user to navigate.

### Home Page Features

- __Home Page__

  - I have used a video for the background to give the user a more enjoyable and unique expearience, while playing the game there is a beautiful beach video in the background. 

  - The background has a black gradient ontop of the image to create a larger contrast in color between the white colored headings and the background video.
