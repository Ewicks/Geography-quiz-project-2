Do you want to improve your knowledge about the world you live on? If so then this is the place. Through a variety of different questions, you will be learn an abundance of information about the world through a fun interative quiz. Rather than read textbooks, I encourage user's to make their learining as fun as possbile. This motivated me to create this quiz.

## Features 

It's important that all pages are responsive on small, medium and large devices. Also that all pages are  
intuitively designed to make it easy for the user to navigate.

### Home Page Features

- __Home Page__

  - I have used a video for the background to give the user a more enjoyable and unique expearience, while playing the game there is a beautiful beach video in the background. 

  - The background has a black gradient ontop of the image to create a larger contrast in color between the white colored headings and the background video.

- __Game Page__

  - This page provides the the question, score, progress bar and four different choices to answer from. 

  - Most of the elements on the page are centered on the page, so it's easy for the user to read.

  - Your score will be updated every updated on every question

  - The user has 1 minute to click an answer, if no answer is clicked, it will automatically go to the next question.
